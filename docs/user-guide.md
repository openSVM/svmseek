# SVMSeek Explorer User Guide

## Getting Started

The SVMSeek Explorer provides a comprehensive view of the Solana blockchain directly within your wallet interface. Access it by clicking the "Explorer" tab in the main wallet view.

## Overview

The Explorer tab contains four main sections:
1. **Search Bar** - Find transactions, accounts, and blocks
2. **Network Statistics** - Real-time Solana network metrics
3. **Recent Blocks** - Live feed of newly produced blocks
4. **Recent Transactions** - Live feed of network transactions

## Using the Search Feature

### What You Can Search For

**Transaction Signatures**
- 88-character strings starting with letters/numbers
- Example: `5VfydnLz8YGV4RqD6DF9hnVxf7YGEWJFaAqN7h1QEi3m9KjH8P1BX3x9yYnA1W4R`
- Shows transaction status, slot, and timestamp

**Account Addresses**
- 44-character strings (Solana public keys)
- Example: `FD1VbCsN8HB8cYaW6P2o9L1YkJiZcBHGdLz4J3x9Y2k`
- Shows account balance and token count

**Block Numbers**
- Numeric identifiers
- Example: `323139497`
- Shows block transactions and timestamp

### Search Tips

1. **Auto-suggestions**: Start typing and wait for suggestions to appear
2. **Keyboard shortcuts**: Use Enter to search, Escape to clear
3. **Copy-paste**: Paste signatures or addresses directly from other sources
4. **Clear search**: Click the X button to clear your search

### Search Results

Results appear instantly below the search bar with:
- **Type indicator**: Color-coded chips showing result type
- **Preview information**: Key details like status, balance, or transaction count
- **Click to explore**: Click any result for more details (future feature)

## Understanding Network Statistics

### Key Metrics

**Block Height**
- Current latest block number
- Updates in real-time as new blocks are produced

**TPS (Transactions Per Second)**
- Current network throughput
- Color indicators:
  - Green: High performance (>3000 TPS)
  - Blue: Normal performance (1000-3000 TPS)
  - Orange: Lower performance (<1000 TPS)

**Active Validators**
- Number of validators currently participating in consensus
- Higher numbers indicate better decentralization

**Current Epoch**
- Solana's time period for validator rotations
- Each epoch is approximately 2-3 days

**Average Block Time**
- How long it takes to produce each block
- Solana targets ~400ms per block

**Total Transactions**
- Cumulative number of transactions processed by the network
- Formatted in millions (M) or billions (B)

**Network Load**
- Percentage of network capacity being used
- Progress bar shows current utilization

## Recent Blocks Section

### What's Displayed

Each block shows:
- **Block number**: Unique identifier
- **Block hash**: Cryptographic fingerprint (truncated)
- **Time ago**: When the block was produced
- **Transaction count**: Number of transactions in the block
- **Block size**: Data size in KB/MB

### Features

- **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 30 seconds
- **Manual refresh**: Click the refresh icon to update immediately
- **Hover effects**: Visual feedback when hovering over blocks
- **Click to explore**: Click any block for detailed view (planned)

### Understanding Block Information

- **Higher transaction counts** indicate busy network periods
- **Consistent timing** shows healthy network performance
- **Block sizes** vary based on transaction complexity

## Recent Transactions Section

### Transaction Information

Each transaction displays:
- **Signature**: Unique transaction identifier (truncated)
- **Status**: Success (green) or Failed (red) indicator
- **Type**: Transaction category (Transfer, Swap, Stake, etc.)
- **Time ago**: When the transaction was processed
- **Fee**: Cost in SOL to process the transaction
- **Slot**: Block slot where transaction was included
- **Account count**: Number of accounts involved

### Transaction Types

**Transfer**: Basic SOL or token transfers
**Swap**: Token exchanges on DEXs
**Stake**: Validator staking operations
**Vote**: Validator voting transactions
**Program Call**: Smart contract interactions
**Token Create**: New token creation
**NFT Mint**: Non-fungible token creation

### Features

- **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 45 seconds
- **Status indicators**: Visual success/failure indicators
- **Manual refresh**: Click refresh icon to update
- **Fee tracking**: Monitor network fee trends

## Tips for Effective Use

### Monitoring Network Health

1. **Check TPS regularly** to understand network performance
2. **Watch network load** to anticipate congestion
3. **Monitor block times** for consistency

### Transaction Analysis

1. **Compare fees** across different transaction types
2. **Track timing patterns** for optimal transaction submission
3. **Monitor success rates** for network reliability

### Search Strategies

1. **Use partial signatures** if you have incomplete transaction IDs
2. **Search by block number** to find transactions from specific times
3. **Explore account addresses** to understand token holdings

## Troubleshooting

### Search Not Working

- Ensure you're using valid Solana addresses/signatures
- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page

### Data Not Updating

- Check if auto-refresh is enabled
- Click manual refresh buttons
- Verify network connectivity

### Performance Issues

- Close other browser tabs to free memory
- Disable browser extensions that might interfere
- Use the latest browser version

## Privacy and Security

### Data Handling

- All searches are processed locally when possible
- Network requests only fetch public blockchain data
- No private keys or sensitive information are transmitted

### Best Practices

- Never enter private keys in search fields
- Verify addresses before interacting with them
- Use the explorer for research, not sensitive operations

## Future Features

### Coming Soon

- **Detailed transaction views**: Full transaction breakdown
- **Account analysis**: Complete token and transaction history
- **Block explorer**: Detailed block information and statistics
- **Advanced filtering**: Filter transactions by type, status, etc.
- **Export functionality**: Save search results and data
- **Real-time alerts**: Notifications for specific events
