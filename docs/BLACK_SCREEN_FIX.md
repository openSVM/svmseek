# SVMSeek Wallet - Black Screen Issue Resolution

This document addresses the black screen issue reported in the web version deployment.

## Issue Summary

Users reported seeing only a black screen when accessing the deployed web version of SVMSeek Wallet. This document outlines the identified causes and implemented fixes.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Issues
The original CSP configuration was potentially too restrictive, blocking necessary resources:

**Previous CSP Issues:**
- Missing `object-src 'none'` directive
- Incomplete WebSocket URL allowlist for Solana RPC
- Missing `manifest-src` directive for PWA functionality
- Missing `data:` scheme for font loading

**Fixed in:** `netlify.toml`

### 2. Environment Variable Configuration
Inconsistent environment variable configuration between development and production builds:

**Issues Fixed:**
- `INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK` set to `false` (should be `true` for better loading)
- Missing `PUBLIC_URL` configuration
- Inconsistent build environment variables

**Fixed in:** `.env.netlify`, `.env.production`

### 3. Build Process Issues
The Netlify build script had several issues that could cause deployment failures:

**Issues Fixed:**
- Missing critical file validation before build
- Insufficient build artifact verification
- No fallback content in index.html for debugging
- Using `buildMaster` command that might not exist

**Fixed in:** `scripts/build-netlify.sh`, `public/index.html`

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Updated Content Security Policy
```toml
Content-Security-Policy = """
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
  font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com data:;
  img-src 'self' data: https: blob:;
  connect-src 'self' https: wss: [Solana RPC endpoints];
  worker-src 'self' blob:;
  child-src 'self' blob:;
  object-src 'none';
  frame-ancestors 'none';
  base-uri 'self';
  form-action 'self';
  manifest-src 'self';
"""
```

### 2. Enhanced Environment Configuration
- Set `INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK=true` for better initial loading
- Added `PUBLIC_URL=/` for correct asset path resolution
- Ensured consistent environment variables across build contexts

### 3. Improved Build Process
- Added comprehensive build validation
- Enhanced error checking and reporting
- Added fallback loading content in `index.html`
- Simplified build commands to use standard `yarn build`

### 4. Added Debugging Fallback Content
Added visible loading content in `index.html` that shows:
- Loading spinner and message
- Instructions to check browser console for errors
- Styled to match the app's dark theme

## Testing the Fixes

### Local Testing
```bash
# Build the application
yarn build

# Serve locally
npx serve -s build

# Check for console errors in browser
```

### Netlify Deployment Testing
1. Deploy to Netlify with the updated configuration
2. Check browser console for any CSP violations or JavaScript errors
3. Verify the loading fallback content appears briefly before the app loads
4. Test all major wallet functionality

## Debugging Steps for Future Issues

If the black screen issue persists:

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Check for CSP violations
   - Verify network requests are completing

2. **Verify Build Artifacts**
   - Ensure `build/index.html` exists and contains React app markup
   - Check that `build/static/js/*.js` files exist
   - Verify CSS files are generated

3. **Test Environment Variables**
   - Confirm all `REACT_APP_*` variables are set correctly
   - Check that API endpoints are accessible

4. **CSP Validation**
   - Use browser dev tools to check for CSP violations
   - Verify all necessary sources are allowed in CSP

## Prevention Measures

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Build validation in CI/CD pipeline
   - End-to-end testing of deployment process
   - Regular CSP compliance checks

2. **Monitoring**
   - Error tracking in production
   - Performance monitoring
   - User experience feedback collection

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep deployment documentation updated
   - Document all environment variables
   - Maintain troubleshooting guides

## Support Information

If users continue to experience the black screen issue:

1. Ask them to check browser console for errors
2. Verify they're using a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. Check if they have JavaScript disabled
4. Test with browser extensions disabled
5. Clear browser cache and cookies

The fallback content now provides clear instructions for users experiencing issues, making troubleshooting much easier.
