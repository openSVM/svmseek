# Force npm/yarn to use HTTPS instead of SSH for GitHub repositories
# This fixes Netlify deployment issues where SSH keys are not available
git-ssh-url = "https://github.com/"
git-https-url = "https://github.com/"

# Rewrite git+ssh URLs to use HTTPS
; This ensures compatibility with build environments like Netlify
; that don't have SSH keys configured for GitHub access
